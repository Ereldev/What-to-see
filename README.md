# What-to-see
Android & iOS app to list future movies & series releases dates  
  
It's a portfolio app, not sure if I will publish it.  
  
This app is realized with KMM framework, Compose for Android views & SwiftUI for iOS views.  
  
# Project architecture

The project dependencies are maintained with [refreshVersions](https://jmfayard.github.io/refreshVersions/] gradle plugin)
